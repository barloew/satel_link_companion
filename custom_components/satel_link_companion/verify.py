"""Satel Link Companion — verifying a link without setting off the alarm.

Two parameters carry the whole link and are NOT readable over the protocol:

    * wiring type (8 = follow output)
    * polarity (DLOADX option POL.+) — applies to virtual outputs too, because
      POL.+ belongs to the output *object*, not to a physical terminal.

They can only be verified, and that must happen alarm-free: a linked zone is
usually continuously monitored (24H), so it alarms even while the system is
disarmed. "Only test with the partition disarmed" is NOT a valid guard.

    Check 1 — passive coherence check: no switching at all, catches polarity
    Check 2 — link test via bypass:    does switch, but cannot alarm
