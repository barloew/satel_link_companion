"""Satel Link Companion — the master panel engine (module C).

Arms and disarms several Satel partitions as one unit, through the base
integration's alarm_control_panel services (Satel Link Companion holds no runtime socket).

Arming is sequential and verified:

    for each partition in order:
        1. run the module D blocker check; blockers -> abort + rollback
        2. call the base arm service (arm_home / arm_away) with the code
        3. wait for that partition to actually reach an armed state
        4. no confirmation -> rollback everything armed so far

Rollback disarms whatever this attempt armed and fires satel_link_companion_arm_failed,
so the master never leaves the system half-armed while the tile claims success.

The code is never stored: Home Assistant (or, for HomeKit, the bridge's
entity_config) supplies it per command and it is passed straight through.
