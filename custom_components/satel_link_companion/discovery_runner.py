"""Satel Link Companion — running discovery against a live Satel Integra Panel.

The ETHM-1 accepts only one client on the integration port. If a base integration
is connected it owns that socket, so the one-off scan must:

    1. unload the base integration        (free the socket)
    2. connect, scan, disconnect          (protocol.discover)
    3. reload the base integration        (restore normal operation)

The interruption is brief and one-off; the result is merged with the existing
HA entities and cached. Kept out of config_flow.py so the flow stays importable
without the Satel Integra Panel library.
