"""Satel Link Companion — a rolling history of zone violations (for breach snapshots).

The breach snapshot answers "which zones were breached when the alarm went
off?" — but at the moment a partition turns `triggered`, the zone that caused it
may already read clear (a walk-through PIR), and a chain reaction may have
followed. So instead of sampling the instant of the trigger, Satel Link Companion keeps a
short rolling history and, on trigger, reports every zone violated in the last
few seconds.

Since Satel Link Companion holds no runtime socket, this history is built from the base
integration's zone binary_sensors — it is a reconstruction on the HA side, not
a read of Satel's own alarm memory. `max_window` caps how far back anything is
kept; individual snapshots ask for their own (possibly shorter) window.

This module is pure: it takes timestamps in, so it can be tested without Home
Assistant.
