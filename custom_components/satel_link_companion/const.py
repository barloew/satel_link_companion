"""Constants for Satel Link Companion.

Satel Link Companion is a companion for the Satel Integra Panel. Its purpose is to
*link* Home Assistant sensors into the Satel Integra Panel as real, armed Satel zones.

Object model — three types, distinguished by direction:

    Zone              Satel -> HA   detection; belongs to a partition
    Output            Satel -> HA   read-only. HA can react to it, never drive it.
    Switchable Output HA -> Satel   output *and* input:
                                      - as an output it drives something (may be virtual)
                                      - as an input it accepts a switch command from HA
                                    That input is what makes linking possible.

The link chain:

    HA sensor -> Switchable Output -> Zone (wiring type 8: follow output) -> Partition

Two parameters carry the whole link but are NOT exposed over the integration
protocol, so they can only be *verified*, never read:

    * wiring type (8 = follow output) — without it the zone does not follow at all
    * polarity (DLOADX option POL.+) — decides whether "active" is right or inverted.
      Applies to virtual outputs too: POL.+ is a property of the output *object*,
      not of a physical terminal.
