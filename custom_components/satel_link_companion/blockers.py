"""Satel Link Companion — the active pre-arm blocker check (module D).

Before arming, which zones must be clear but are violated? These are the
"blockers" — Satel's denial of arming. The check runs against the base
integration's zone binary_sensors (Satel Link Companion holds no socket), filtered by
zone function: only plain burglary zones block. 24-hour zones are always active
and entry/exit zones may be open while you leave, so neither counts.

A zone the user linked through Satel Link Companion participates like any physical zone:
if it is a burglary zone and currently violated, it blocks too.

Pure: violation lookup is injected, so this is testable without Home Assistant.
